								<h2>History of digital currencies</h2>
								<span class="byline"></span>
							</header>
							<p>The rise of virtual currencies like Bitcoin has gained momentum on press sites and social media; regardless of the tone of conversation, crypto currencies have been mentioned widely. As a proponent of digital currencies myself, particularly for Africa, I see this as a step forward. There is a dearth, however, of exploratory analysis on the origins of virtual currencies beyond Satoshi Nakamoto. Digital currency was envisioned as far back as the 80s and implemented with varying degrees of success; today’s crypto-currencies are a logical evolution. Satoshi Nakamoto’s predecessors had the foresight of a digital currency for more efficient economies. Their exemplary efforts: Ricardian contracts, e-gold, e-cash are the _______ in a chain of human evolution. It is only right that we pay homage.</p>
							<p>On his blog, financial cryptography, Ian Griggs perfectly sums up my blog attempts</p>
							<blockquote>Before Bitcoin, there was cryptocurrency. Indeed, it [crypto-currency] has a long and deep history. If only for the lessons learnt, it is worth studying, and indeed, in my ABC of Bitcoin investing, I consider not knowing anything before the [Satoshi White Paper] paper as a red flag.</blockquote>
							<p>The Internet – eCan of Worms!</p>
							<p>The birth of the internet was a drastic paradigm shift turning thoughts about almost everything completely on their heads; only few could imagine the infinite possibilities in the earlier stages, while others dismissed it. One of these thoughts, digital payment systems over the internet communication protocol. Simple, send digital value tokens over the internet just like physical cash. David Chaum, alongside a team, had toyed around with the idea of electronic cash in Netherlands under the company DigiCash. While notably a huge leap, Digicash failed as an organization.</p>
							<p>To emulate exchange of value via cash in the real world, some basic properties are essential. </p>
							<ul>
								<li>A token of value should be uniquely identifiable and cannot be spent twice. If you have it, I can’t have the same exact coin. It has a unique ID.</li>
								<li>Cash is largely untraceable. A bank cannot determine who has been in touch with a coin that you present for deposit. </li>
								
							</ul>
							<p>These attributes are desirable in any system seeking to emulate a real world money system. David chaum had figured out a secure, efficient and low cost way to achieve this with his earlier attempt at DigiCash. The internet was an opportunity to take it further. ECash was born from this attempt in 1993 as a secure and anonymous digital payment system. The team behind it comprised of ex-Digicash employees:  Stefan Brands, Niels Ferguson, Gary Howland, Marcel "BigMac" van der Peijl, Nick Szabo, and Bryce "Zooko" Wilcox-Ahearn</p>
							<p>A unique digital stamp by an issuer/mint certified a token as backed by fiat reserves. The token could then be exchanged by a user as value. Alice, on receiving a token from Bob as payment for goods, would present this token to the issuer to confirm its authenticity. The mint would then confirm that the token is valid as per records. Bob transfers goods to Alice and either retains the token for future transactions or redeems it for fiat money. This ensured the token could only be spent once – a problem ubiquitously referred to as the double spend problem. The blinding formula, a cryptographic algorithm invented by Chaum, made the token untraceable without compromising the issuer’s digital signature of validity, just like physical cash.</p>
							<p>Ecash was midly successful and had all the potential to prosper wildly. It sparked interest from corporations at the time: Microsoft offered to buy it for $100 million, ING Investment Managers offered to take it public alongside Goldman Sacchs, Netscape, Visa and Banks also lined up for a piece. Ecash was technically sound as a product, but, perpetual poor management of Ecash resulted in its failure.</p>
							<p>The failure of Digicash and Ecash paved the way for web based money issuers that recognized the opportunity of email-like money transfers. PayPal has grown since then and eclipsed the ideas of Chaum, until now.</p>
							<h2>Emergence of Present Day Crypto Currency</h2>
							<p>Bitcoin surfaced in 2009 and has spawned a litter of crypto currencies since then. A full list of them can be seen here. Through Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto was able to achieve the successes of previous digital currencies but with a unique twist – a decentralized peer to peer no-trust based network in place of a central mint. Genius!</p>
							<p>Centralized systems have come under criticism for bringing down ecosystems from single points of failure. They are prone to attacks that threaten to bring down the systems they manage. Mt. Gox is an example of a failure of centralization  –  NOT crypto-currencies. A decentralized approach distributes the function of a central issuer such as a mint, across a peer to peer network and is automatically robust and secure. Enormous benefits are derived from its protocol for transactions and transfer of value. O transfer cost, instantaneous transfer, non-reversibility of transactions, consensus based validation of transactions, public records of transactions and much more. One distinguishing quality that sets it apart for other digital currencies is that it is not backed by fiat (Ecash) or physical assets (Egold). It derives its value from the perceived value of the Bitcoin protocol. Commonly referenced –wild volatility swings -  are as a result of free market forces. Obviously, there people who see value in Bitcoin; its price is indicative of this perceived value. Whether it is overpriced or underpriced, will be understood over time – no different from the prices of company stocks whose future is largely forecasted, but still an unknown.</p>
							<p>Satoshi Nakamoto wrote this after <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10162.html">releasing the code</a></p>
							<blockquote>You know, I think there were a lot more people interested in [digital currencies] the 90's, but after more than a decade of failed Trusted Third Party based systems (Digicash, etc), they see it as a lost cause. I hope they can make the distinction that this is the first time I know of that we're trying a non-trust-based system. – Satoshi Nakamoto</blockquote>
